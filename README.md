# Gavril Lucian-Adrian

**Data Science · Machine Learning · Backend Engineering · AI Systems**

I build systems that combine Machine Learning, structured data pipelines, and scalable backend components.  
My focus: **turning raw data into working products** — models, agents, APIs, dashboards, and applied analytics.

---

## 🔬 Current Focus

- Data Science & ML projects (regression, classification, forecasting, statistical modeling)
- Python-based ML pipelines (Pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy)
- Backend engineering with TypeScript / Node.js
- AI agents for automation, data processing, and product workflows
- Optimizing database schemas, queries, and business formulas
